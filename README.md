# Javascript Text/Excel File Uploader/Converter for [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).
This is a [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) template of Javascript file
uploader/converter. I often create a web all that accepts a text file or an
Excel file, reads info from them, processes data, and outputs something. This
t is the template for that process.

My apps are based on this post:

 - [How to parse Excel (XLS) file in Javascript/HTML5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8238407/how-to-parse-excel-file-in-javascript-html5)
 - [Upload an excel file here and you can get the data in JSON format in console](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52870648/1797738)

Parser used are:

 - Text file parser [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/).

 - Excel file parser [xlsx](https://sheetjs.com/).
